# Hello-world
This is my first step in GitHub! It's really cool.

Nice to meet you!

Well, from now on, I would like to upload some of my notes of coding, no matter exact coding language such as R, Python etc. or anything related to them. By doing this, I want to record my learning procedure and also help others if possible and I'm glad to see so :)

Here are the Contents:
## R Notes (R in Action)
### Chapter 2
### Chapter 3
### Chapter 4
### Chapter 5

## Github Notes
### Add a SSH-Key
### Avoid inputing username and password
