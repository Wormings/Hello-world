# Hello-world
This is my first step in GitHub! It's really cool.

Nice to meet you!

Well, from now on, I would like to upload some of my notes of coding, no matter exact coding language such as R, Python etc. or anything related to them. By doing this, I want to record my learning procedure and also help others if possible and I'm glad to see so :)

Here are the Contents:
